# PortfolioChallenge

## Description
The goal of this project was to create a portfolio that details me, and shows my most recent work with links to them as well.

## Key Points
1. Added tiles of previous projects and future projects to be completed, along with link to deployed application.
2. Presented name, recent photo, and contact information.
3. Nav elements link to relevant sections.
4. First project is larger than the others.
5. Clicking on project image links to deployed project.
6. Mediaqueries are present for ease of use across multiple devices/screen sizes.
